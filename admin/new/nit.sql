It is one of the primitive branches of Engineering which have remained always in demand and continue to be in the future. Mechanical engineers have always been needed as an essential staff personnel in various industries of both public and private sector. Their work criteria changes according to the type and domain of the company they are working with. As the Industrial sector has drastically risen in pace, the need for more mechanical engineers has increased exponentially. Every manufacturing and production industry needs mechanical engineers to carry out jobs efficiently and flawlessly for their companies.</p><p><b>Objectives&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p><p>Machine Design starts with Engineering Drawing, a method for engineering communication. It continues with Machine Component Design, utilising knowledge obtained from studies in Engineering Mechanics and Materials. The combination of Machine Design and Industrial Design can produce a modified or new design that satisfies the consumersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ need, is easy to use and looks attractive.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Text Books</b></p><p>T1&nbsp; P.Kannaiah- Machine Design 2 edition Ã¢â‚¬â€œScitech Publication Pvt.Ltd.

The combined cycle is the synergetic combination of gas turbine as topping cycle and steam turbine as bottoming cycle. Nowadays, combined cycle is also being called the power plant of twenty-first century. A high profile development of combined cycle (funded by various government agencies worldwide) is currently in progress by major power plant manufacturing companies. At present, combined cycle power plant employing simple (basic) gas turbine cycle and two or three pressure level reheat steam cycle and having exhaust temperature varying from 850K to 915K yields thermal efficiency ranging from 57 to 60% at ISO conditions. This technology leads to the optimum utilisation of fuel burnt in the gas turbine.</p><p>The current emphasis is on the development of gas turbine cycle for further enhancement in its performance, by increasing turbine inlet temperature (TIT), compressor pressure ratio (r<sub>p,c</sub>), increased component efficiencies, better materials, better cooling means (medium and techniques), and complex configurations employing intercooling, reheating and recuperation. These developments require active cooling of the hot turbine components in order to avoid a reduction of operating life due to unfavourable combination of oxidation, creep and thermal stresses. However, the coolant flow can become so large that the excess compressor power for compressing coolant can offset the power gains associated with incremental increase of TIT. This necessitates the requirements of better cooling means and techniques along with better materials.</p><p>The review of literature on combined and co-generation cycles shows that an extensive research is needed in the direction of enhancement of performance of combined cycles. My PhD work has focused on energy and exergy analysis of combined and cogeneration cycles using different means of turbine blade cooling for various configurations.</p><p>The following&nbsp; blade cooling means had been considered: -&nbsp;</p><p><b>1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Open loop cooling</b></p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal convection and impingement air cooling</p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal and film air-cooling.</p><p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transpiration air-cooling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal convection steam cooling</p><p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal convection film steam cooling.</p><p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal convection transpiration steam cooling.</p><p><b>2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Closed loop cooling.</b></p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steam cooling.</p><p>The thermodynamic analysis of selected configuration of combined and cogeneration systems numbering fourteen, with a combination of some of the seven cooling means have been studied by modeling the various elements of combined cycle for real situations. The models selected/ developed for the elements include for gas, compressor, intercooler, combustor, cooled gas turbines, recuperator, heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), and its optimization, steam turbine, condenser, deaerator, feed-pump, etc. The optimization of HRSG has been performed to find the correct amount of steam generated for single or multi-pressure cases by satisfying the pinch points, minimum allowable stack temperature and minimum allowable quality of steam turbine exhaust, For steam properties a database has been prepared using standard steam tables. The fuel used in the analysis is natural gas. Based on the modelings, the desired parameters of various elements have been obtained/studied, by using mass, energy and exergy balances. Based on these modelings, governing equations have been developed for predicting the performance of combined and cogeneration cycles.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Current and future research interests</b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward the areas of research interest have expanded in the following direction:</p><ul><li>Energy, exergy and emission analysis of gas turbine based combined cycles.</li><li>Thermodynamic analysis of biomass and natural-gas based hybrid green energy conversion.</li><li>Thermodynamic analysis of gas turbine based cycles for sustainable energy conversion</li><li>Exergy and emission analysis of various power plant cycles towards green energy conversion systems</li></ul><p>Funding for research in this area may be sought from government and private agencies funding preliminary research in green energy conversion cycles eg.

It is one of the primitive branches of Engineering which have remained always in demand and continue to be in the future. Mechanical engineers have always been needed as an essential staff personnel in various industries of both public and private sector. Their work criteria changes according to the type and domain of the company they are working with. As the Industrial sector has drastically risen in pace, the need for more mechanical engineers has increased exponentially. Every manufacturing and production industry needs mechanical engineers to carry out jobs efficiently and flawlessly for their companies.</p><p><b>Objectives&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p><p>Machine Design starts with Engineering Drawing, a method for engineering communication. It continues with Machine Component Design, utilising knowledge obtained from studies in Engineering Mechanics and Materials. The combination of Machine Design and Industrial Design can produce a modified or new design that satisfies the consumersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ need, is easy to use and looks attractive.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Text Books</b></p><p>T1&nbsp; P.Kannaiah- Machine Design 2 edition Ã¢â‚¬â€œScitech Publication Pvt.Ltd.

The combined cycle is the synergetic combination of gas turbine as topping cycle and steam turbine as bottoming cycle. Nowadays, combined cycle is also being called the power plant of twenty-first century. A high profile development of combined cycle (funded by various government agencies worldwide) is currently in progress by major power plant manufacturing companies. At present, combined cycle power plant employing simple (basic) gas turbine cycle and two or three pressure level reheat steam cycle and having exhaust temperature varying from 850K to 915K yields thermal efficiency ranging from 57 to 60% at ISO conditions. This technology leads to the optimum utilisation of fuel burnt in the gas turbine.</p><p>The current emphasis is on the development of gas turbine cycle for further enhancement in its performance, by increasing turbine inlet temperature (TIT), compressor pressure ratio (r<sub>p,c</sub>), increased component efficiencies, better materials, better cooling means (medium and techniques), and complex configurations employing intercooling, reheating and recuperation. These developments require active cooling of the hot turbine components in order to avoid a reduction of operating life due to unfavourable combination of oxidation, creep and thermal stresses. However, the coolant flow can become so large that the excess compressor power for compressing coolant can offset the power gains associated with incremental increase of TIT. This necessitates the requirements of better cooling means and techniques along with better materials.</p><p>The review of literature on combined and co-generation cycles shows that an extensive research is needed in the direction of enhancement of performance of combined cycles. My PhD work has focused on energy and exergy analysis of combined and cogeneration cycles using different means of turbine blade cooling for various configurations.</p><p>The following&nbsp; blade cooling means had been considered: -&nbsp;</p><p><b>1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Open loop cooling</b></p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal convection and impingement air cooling</p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal and film air-cooling.</p><p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transpiration air-cooling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal convection steam cooling</p><p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal convection film steam cooling.</p><p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal convection transpiration steam cooling.</p><p><b>2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Closed loop cooling.</b></p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steam cooling.</p><p>The thermodynamic analysis of selected configuration of combined and cogeneration systems numbering fourteen, with a combination of some of the seven cooling means have been studied by modeling the various elements of combined cycle for real situations. The models selected/ developed for the elements include for gas, compressor, intercooler, combustor, cooled gas turbines, recuperator, heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), and its optimization, steam turbine, condenser, deaerator, feed-pump, etc. The optimization of HRSG has been performed to find the correct amount of steam generated for single or multi-pressure cases by satisfying the pinch points, minimum allowable stack temperature and minimum allowable quality of steam turbine exhaust, For steam properties a database has been prepared using standard steam tables. The fuel used in the analysis is natural gas. Based on the modelings, the desired parameters of various elements have been obtained/studied, by using mass, energy and exergy balances. Based on these modelings, governing equations have been developed for predicting the performance of combined and cogeneration cycles.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Current and future research interests</b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward the areas of research interest have expanded in the following direction:</p><ul><li>Energy, exergy and emission analysis of gas turbine based combined cycles.</li><li>Thermodynamic analysis of biomass and natural-gas based hybrid green energy conversion.</li><li>Thermodynamic analysis of gas turbine based cycles for sustainable energy conversion</li><li>Exergy and emission analysis of various power plant cycles towards green energy conversion systems</li></ul><p>Funding for research in this area may be sought from government and private agencies funding preliminary research in green energy conversion cycles eg.

It is one of the primitive branches of Engineering which have remained always in demand and continue to be in the future. Mechanical engineers have always been needed as an essential staff personnel in various industries of both public and private sector. Their work criteria changes according to the type and domain of the company they are working with. As the Industrial sector has drastically risen in pace, the need for more mechanical engineers has increased exponentially. Every manufacturing and production industry needs mechanical engineers to carry out jobs efficiently and flawlessly for their companies.</p><p><b>Objectives&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p><p>Machine Design starts with Engineering Drawing, a method for engineering communication. It continues with Machine Component Design, utilising knowledge obtained from studies in Engineering Mechanics and Materials. The combination of Machine Design and Industrial Design can produce a modified or new design that satisfies the consumersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ need, is easy to use and looks attractive.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Text Books</b></p><p>T1&nbsp; P.Kannaiah- Machine Design 2 edition Ã¢â‚¬â€œScitech Publication Pvt.Ltd.

The combined cycle is the synergetic combination of gas turbine as topping cycle and steam turbine as bottoming cycle. Nowadays, combined cycle is also being called the power plant of twenty-first century. A high profile development of combined cycle (funded by various government agencies worldwide) is currently in progress by major power plant manufacturing companies. At present, combined cycle power plant employing simple (basic) gas turbine cycle and two or three pressure level reheat steam cycle and having exhaust temperature varying from 850K to 915K yields thermal efficiency ranging from 57 to 60% at ISO conditions. This technology leads to the optimum utilisation of fuel burnt in the gas turbine.</p><p>The current emphasis is on the development of gas turbine cycle for further enhancement in its performance, by increasing turbine inlet temperature (TIT), compressor pressure ratio (r<sub>p,c</sub>), increased component efficiencies, better materials, better cooling means (medium and techniques), and complex configurations employing intercooling, reheating and recuperation. These developments require active cooling of the hot turbine components in order to avoid a reduction of operating life due to unfavourable combination of oxidation, creep and thermal stresses. However, the coolant flow can become so large that the excess compressor power for compressing coolant can offset the power gains associated with incremental increase of TIT. This necessitates the requirements of better cooling means and techniques along with better materials.</p><p>The review of literature on combined and co-generation cycles shows that an extensive research is needed in the direction of enhancement of performance of combined cycles. My PhD work has focused on energy and exergy analysis of combined and cogeneration cycles using different means of turbine blade cooling for various configurations.</p><p>The following&nbsp; blade cooling means had been considered: -&nbsp;</p><p><b>1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Open loop cooling</b></p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal convection and impingement air cooling</p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal and film air-cooling.</p><p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transpiration air-cooling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal convection steam cooling</p><p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal convection film steam cooling.</p><p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal convection transpiration steam cooling.</p><p><b>2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Closed loop cooling.</b></p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steam cooling.</p><p>The thermodynamic analysis of selected configuration of combined and cogeneration systems numbering fourteen, with a combination of some of the seven cooling means have been studied by modeling the various elements of combined cycle for real situations. The models selected/ developed for the elements include for gas, compressor, intercooler, combustor, cooled gas turbines, recuperator, heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), and its optimization, steam turbine, condenser, deaerator, feed-pump, etc. The optimization of HRSG has been performed to find the correct amount of steam generated for single or multi-pressure cases by satisfying the pinch points, minimum allowable stack temperature and minimum allowable quality of steam turbine exhaust, For steam properties a database has been prepared using standard steam tables. The fuel used in the analysis is natural gas. Based on the modelings, the desired parameters of various elements have been obtained/studied, by using mass, energy and exergy balances. Based on these modelings, governing equations have been developed for predicting the performance of combined and cogeneration cycles.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Current and future research interests</b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward the areas of research interest have expanded in the following direction:</p><ul><li>Energy, exergy and emission analysis of gas turbine based combined cycles.</li><li>Thermodynamic analysis of biomass and natural-gas based hybrid green energy conversion.</li><li>Thermodynamic analysis of gas turbine based cycles for sustainable energy conversion</li><li>Exergy and emission analysis of various power plant cycles towards green energy conversion systems</li></ul><p>Funding for research in this area may be sought from government and private agencies funding preliminary research in green energy conversion cycles eg.
